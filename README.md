# Ap_project
The Ap project for computer class

# Information/README

So, in simple terms its a basic music player ( mp3 player )
it was made with a the following idea "why is there ads playing in between songs"
and so I made my own mp3 player with a simple yet mordern theme also it's open source
so that means if you mod it you make it open source no questions ask

now in case of Bugs feel free to make a request in github

# Update

So heres the update to the project to make it more smooth as well makeing it into a CLI program
until the GUI develoment starts somewhere in April or May
